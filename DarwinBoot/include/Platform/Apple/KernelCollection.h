 *
 * The newer KernelCollection format has likely been in the works since around 2018, given the
 * fact that dyld's API for libKernelCollectionBuilder was given an API_AVAILABLE of macOS Mojave.
 *
 * The KernelCollection files are made up of a collection of Mach-O files, being called a 'fileset'
 * under the hood.
 *
 * With fileset kernelcache files, Apple didn't bother with compression, leaving the final file
 * with a standard Mach-O header (thank god) and creating a new Mach-O file type.
